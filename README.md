Create a single player black jack games that plays against the house, i.e. a human player and computer dealer. You are free to create the user interface however you want, but keep it simple for Explorer Mode.

General Rules:

* The game should be played with a standard deck of playing cards (52).
* The house should be dealt two cards, hidden from the player until the house reveals its hand.
* The player should be dealt a hand that contains two cards, visible to the player.
* The player should have a chance to hit (i.e. be dealt another card) until they decide to stop or they bust (i.e. their total is over 21 ).
* When the player stands, the house will reveal its hand and hit (i.e. draw cards) until they have 17 or more.
* If either the house or the player bust, they lose.
Explorer Mode
- [X] The player should have two choices: "Hit" and "Stand"
- [X] Consider Aces to be worth 11, never 1.
- [X] The page should display the the winner. For this mode, the winner is defined as who was closer to a blackjack (21) without going over.
- [X] There should be an option to play again; this should reset the hands and reshuffle the deck.
Adventure Mode
- [ ] Reveal one of the house's cards to the player when cards are first dealt.
- [ ] Consider aces be worth one or eleven.
- [ ] Allow the player to "Split".
- [ ] Improve the win requirements. From Wikipedia:
  | Players win by not busting and having a total higher than the dealer, or not busting and having the dealer bust, | or getting a blackjack without the dealer getting a blackjack. If the player and dealer have the same total (not | counting blackjacks), this is called a "push", and the player typically does not win or lose money on that hand. | Otherwise, the dealer wins.

Epic Mode
- [ ] Add a betting system that carries between rounds
- [ ] Allow the player to "Double down" or "Surrender"
- [ ] Add more Players
